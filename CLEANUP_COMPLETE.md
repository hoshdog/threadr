```

## 🚀 Current Production Configuration

### Vercel (Frontend)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://threadr-pw0s.onrender.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://threadr-plum.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Render.com (Backend)
```env
PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Phase 2

### 1. Activate Full Backend (Priority)
Add to Render.com environment variables:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=(your new rotated key)
REDIS_URL=(from Upstash or Redis Cloud)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=(from Stripe dashboard)
CORS_ORIGINS=https://threadr-plum.vercel.app
```

Then update `render.yaml`:
```yaml
startCommand: uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
(Change from `main_minimal` to `main`)

### 2. Set Up Redis
Options:
- **Upstash**: Serverless Redis, free tier available
- **Redis Cloud**: 30MB free tier
- Configure for rate limiting and caching

### 3. Implement User Authentication
- Login/Register pages already exist in Next.js
- Connect to backend `/api/auth/` endpoints
- Implement JWT token storage

### 4. Activate Stripe Payments
- Add webhook endpoint
- Configure subscription tiers
- Enable premium features

## 🔒 Security Status
