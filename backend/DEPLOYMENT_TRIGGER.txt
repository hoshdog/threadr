Target: main_minimal.py
Purpose: CRITICAL DEBUG - Enhanced nixpacks with explicit verification and cache busting

CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Enhanced nixpacks.toml with:
- Explicit build phase verification of main_minimal.py
- Detailed setup phase logging
- Cache busting environment variables  
- Anti-detection variables to prevent Python buildpack override
- Should now FORCE deploy src.main_minimal:app as specified
