Railway Deployment Trigger
==========================

This file forces Railway to rebuild the application.

Last Updated: 2025-08-05 10:35:00  
Target: main_minimal.py
Purpose: FORCE NIXPACKS - Removed runtime.txt and pyproject.toml to prevent Python buildpack override

CRITICAL FIX: Railway was using Python buildpack instead of nixpacks
- Backed up runtime.txt and pyproject.toml  
- This should now force Railway to use nixpacks.toml configuration
- Should deploy src.main_minimal:app as specified in nixpacks.toml
