## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If APIs Still Return 404
1. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - View deployment logs
   - Look for "Authentication and thread routers initialized successfully"

2. **Verify Routes**:
   - Test: `curl https://threadr-pw0s.onrender.com/api/premium/check`
   - Should NOT return 404

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all Stripe keys are set
   - JWT_SECRET_KEY configured
   - Redis URL working

### If Frontend Issues Persist
1. **Browser Cache**: Clear cache and try incognito
2. **Console Errors**: Check for JavaScript errors
3. **API URLs**: Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is correct
4. **CORS**: Ensure Render has frontend URL in CORS_ORIGINS

### If Payments Don't Work
1. **Stripe Config**: Check if webhook endpoints are configured
2. **Environment Variables**: Verify all Stripe keys in Render
3. **API Routes**: Ensure subscription endpoints are working
