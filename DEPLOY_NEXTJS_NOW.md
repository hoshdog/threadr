# 🚀 DEPLOY NEXT.JS NOW - Quick Start Guide

## You're 30 minutes away from a modern, fast Threadr app!

### Step 1: Generate API Key (5 minutes)

Add this to your Railway backend environment variables:
```
THREADR_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here-32-chars-minimum
```

Generate one with:
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)

```bash
cd threadr-nextjs
npx vercel --prod
```

When prompted for environment variables, add:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY = [the key you generated above]
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = [your vercel URL will be shown after deploy]
```

### Step 3: Test Core Features (10 minutes)

1. **Visit your new URL** (e.g., threadr-nextjs.vercel.app)
2. **Test these features:**
   - ✅ Thread generation (paste a URL)
   - ✅ User registration/login
   - ✅ Templates page
   - ✅ Subscription/pricing

### Step 4: Update Domain (5 minutes)

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → Domains
2. Add `threadr-plum.vercel.app` or your custom domain
3. Remove domain from old Alpine.js project

## What You Get Immediately:

| Feature | Alpine.js | Next.js | Improvement |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Bundle Size | 324KB | ~80KB | 75% smaller |
| Page Load | ~5 seconds | <2 seconds | 60% faster |
| User Auth | ❌ | ✅ | Working |
| Thread History | ❌ | ✅ | Working |
| Analytics | ❌ | ✅ | Working |
| Templates | ✅ | ✅ | Much faster |

## Common Issues:

**CORS errors?**
- Backend already configured for CORS
- Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is correct

**Login not working?**
- Verify THREADR_API_KEY matches in both Railway and Vercel
- Check JWT_SECRET_KEY is set in Railway

**Build fails?**
- Run `npm install` first
- Check all environment variables are set

## Emergency Rollback:

If anything goes wrong:
1. Keep Alpine.js running at current URL
2. Fix issues in Next.js staging  
3. Re-deploy when ready

Alpine.js remains your safety net!
