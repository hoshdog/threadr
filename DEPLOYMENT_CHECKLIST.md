- [x] Created comprehensive documentation

### Local Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Build script runs without errors
- [x] Files copied correctly to `dist/` directory
- [x] Environment variable injection logic working
- [x] Fallback mechanism functioning as expected
- [x] Debug logging provides clear status information

## Vercel Environment Variable Setup

### Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard
1. [ ] Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in
2. [ ] Navigate to Threadr project
3. [ ] Click "Settings" tab
4. [ ] Click "Environment Variables" in sidebar

### Step 2: Add API Key Environment Variable
1. [ ] Click "Add New" button
2. [ ] Enter environment variable details:
   - **Name**: `THREADR_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `zfQBge1AsBBLF8nMNxiHdyFn-_fS7vsTtcTrveXnyD8`
   - **Environments**: Select ALL (Production, Preview, Development)
3. [ ] Click "Save"
4. [ ] Verify variable appears in environment variables list

### Step 3: Verify Build Configuration
1. [ ] Check that build command is set to `node build.js`
2. [ ] Verify output directory is set to `dist`
3. [ ] Confirm install command includes build dependencies

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Deploy to Production
1. [ ] Commit all changes to git repository
2. [ ] Push to main branch (triggers Vercel deployment)
3. [ ] Monitor deployment in Vercel dashboard

### Step 2: Monitor Build Process
Watch for these key indicators in build logs:
- [ ] ✅ "Injecting API key from environment variable" (SUCCESS)
- [ ] ❌ "No THREADR_API_KEY environment variable found" (NEEDS SETUP)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment Success
1. [ ] Deployment completes without errors
2. [ ] Site loads correctly at production URL
3. [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Security Verification
1. [ ] **Browser Console Check**: 
   - Open browser console on production site
   - Should NOT see: "Using fallback API key" warning
   - Should see clean initialization logs

2. [ ] **Source Code Inspection**:
   - Right-click → "View Page Source"
   - Search for API key string
   - ❌ Key should NOT be visible in HTML
   - ❌ Key should NOT be visible in JavaScript files

3. [ ] **Network Tab Verification**:
   - Open developer tools → Network tab
   - Check `config.js` file contents
   - ❌ API key should NOT be visible

### Functionality Verification
1. [ ] **Core Features Working**:
   - URL input accepts valid URLs
   - Content generation works correctly
   - Rate limiting functions properly
   - Payment system operational

2. [ ] **API Communication**:
   - Backend API calls successful
   - No authentication errors
   - Rate limiting applies correctly

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### Immediate Rollback
If critical issues occur:
1. [ ] Revert to previous Vercel deployment
2. [ ] Check previous deployment in Vercel dashboard
3. [ ] Click "..." → "Promote to Production"

### Environment Variable Issues
If environment variable problems:
1. [ ] Double-check environment variable name: `THREADR_API_KEY`
2. [ ] Verify value is correctly set
3. [ ] Ensure all environments selected
4. [ ] Redeploy to apply changes

### Build Process Issues
If build fails:
1. [ ] Check build logs for specific errors
2. [ ] Verify `build.js` file syntax
3. [ ] Test build process locally
4. [ ] Fix issues and redeploy

## Success Criteria

### Security Requirements ✅
- [ ] API key not visible in frontend source code
- [ ] Environment variable injection working correctly
- [ ] No fallback warnings in production console
- [ ] Secure key management through Vercel dashboard

### Functionality Requirements ✅
- [ ] All existing features working correctly
- [ ] No breaking changes to user experience
- [ ] API communication functioning properly
- [ ] Rate limiting and payments operational

### Performance Requirements ✅
- [ ] Page load times unchanged or improved
- [ ] Build process completes in reasonable time
- [ ] No additional network requests or delays

## Post-Success Actions

### Phase 2: Remove Fallback Mechanism (Recommended within 1 week)
Once environment variables confirmed working:
1. [ ] Remove fallback API key from `config.js`
2. [ ] Replace with error handling for missing environment variable
3. [ ] Test thoroughly in staging environment
4. [ ] Deploy to production

### Phase 3: Enhanced Security (Future)
1. [ ] Implement key rotation procedures
2. [ ] Add API key usage monitoring
3. [ ] Consider environment-specific API keys
4. [ ] Add automated security scanning

## Contact and Support

### If Issues Occur
1. **Check build logs** in Vercel dashboard first
2. **Test locally** using `node build.js` in frontend directory
3. **Verify environment variables** in Vercel settings
4. **Monitor browser console** for specific error messages

### Key Files for Troubleshooting
- `/frontend/build.js` - Build process logic
- `/frontend/vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- `/frontend/public/config.js` - Configuration logic
- `/VERCEL_SECURITY_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions

## Final Verification Checklist

Before marking deployment as complete:
- [ ] Security vulnerability eliminated (API key not in source)
- [ ] Environment variable system functional
- [ ] All existing features working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated and complete
- [ ] Team notified of successful security fix
- [ ] Plan created for removing fallback mechanism

**Deployment Status**: Ready for production deployment
**Risk Level**: Low (backward compatible with fallback mechanism)
**Expected Benefits**: Critical security vulnerability resolved, improved key management
