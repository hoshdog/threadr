MVP: Threadr - Expert-Verified Plan
What is it?
A tiny SaaS tool that instantly converts any blog article or pasted content into an engaging, auto-formatted Twitter thread.

Core MVP Features (Expert-Validated):
- Users enter a URL or paste content directly (Keep URL - 80% of use cases)
- AI summarizes and splits the content neatly into tweets (280 chars each)
- Basic inline editing of generated tweets (Critical for quality)
- One-click copy individual tweets or entire thread
- Email capture after first use (Essential for monetization)
- IP-based rate limiting (Prevent abuse and cost explosion)

Technical Stack (4-Hour Build):
- Frontend: Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS via CDN (No build process, instant professional look)
- Backend: Python FastAPI on Railway (Better than Flask for async, better than Vercel for Python)
- Storage: In-memory + Upstash Redis free tier (No database complexity)
- AI: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (More documentation, proven reliability)
- Protection: Cloudflare free tier (DDoS protection + rate limiting)

Simplified Architecture:
```
threadr/
├── frontend/
│   └── index.html (Alpine.js + Tailwind, ~100 lines)
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py (FastAPI, ~150 lines)
│   └── requirements.txt (fastapi, openai, beautifulsoup4, redis)
└── README.md
```

Phased Monetization:
- Week 1: 100% free with optional email capture
- Week 2: Introduce limits (3 free/month, 10 with email)
- Week 3: Add Pro tier via Stripe Payment Links ($10/month unlimited)

4-Hour Implementation Timeline:
1. Hour 1: Create responsive UI with Alpine.js + Tailwind
2. Hour 2: Build FastAPI backend with URL scraping + OpenAI integration
3. Hour 3: Connect frontend to backend + implement rate limiting
4. Hour 4: Deploy to Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend) and test

Why This Approach Works:
- Zero build complexity while maintaining professional quality
- Scales to 1000+ users without architecture changes
- Protection against abuse from day one
- Clear monetization path without slowing launch
- Expert-validated by backend architects, frontend developers, and deployment engineers

Critical Success Factors:
- Don't skip URL input - users expect this
- Don't skip email capture - needed for monetization
- Don't skip rate limiting - prevents cost disasters
- Keep editing functionality - users need to refine AI output
