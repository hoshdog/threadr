## Phase 1.5: Next.js Migration (ðŸ”„ CURRENT - August 2025)

### Architecture Migration Requirements
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for complete migration
**Priority**: Essential for scaling beyond current limits

#### Migration Drivers
- **File Size Limit**: 260KB monolithic HTML file causes performance issues
- **Scope Pollution**: 50+ Alpine.js data objects create variable conflicts  
- **Navigation Issues**: Complex DOM manipulation causes browser performance degradation
- **Development Velocity**: Adding features becomes increasingly difficult
- **Team Scaling**: Multiple developers cannot work simultaneously

#### Migration Benefits (Quantified)
- **Bundle Size**: 260KB â†’ ~80KB (70% reduction)
- **Load Time**: 3-4 seconds â†’ <1 second
- **Navigation**: Page reloads â†’ Instant client-side routing
- **Developer Experience**: Global scope debugging â†’ React DevTools + TypeScript
- **Team Collaboration**: Single developer â†’ Multiple simultaneous developers

#### Next.js Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router and Server Components
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better DX
- **State Management**: React Query (server state) + Zustand (client state)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (unchanged)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright E2E

#### Migration Timeline
**Week 1**: Foundation setup, API integration, core thread generation  
**Week 2**: Feature parity (templates, history, analytics, accounts)  
**Week 3**: Polish, performance optimization, comprehensive testing  
**Week 4**: Production deployment, user migration, Alpine.js deprecation
