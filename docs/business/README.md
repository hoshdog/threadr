# Business Strategy & Revenue Analysis

> **ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY GOAL**: Achieve $1,000 MRR by end of month - requires 200 premium users @ $4.99

## Current Business Reality

### Live Production Metrics
- **Revenue Model**: $4.99 for 30-day premium access (NOT recurring)
- **Free Tier**: 5 daily / 20 monthly thread generations
- **Current MRR**: Unknown (no recurring billing system)
- **User Base**: Anonymous users only (no accounts)
- **Conversion Tracking**: Limited visibility into user behavior

### Critical Business Issues
1. **Non-Recurring Revenue**: $4.99 is one-time payment, not subscription
2. **No User Retention**: Anonymous users can't build relationship with product
3. **Limited Analytics**: Can't track actual conversion rates or user behavior
4. **Revenue Leakage**: Users might exploit free tier without converting
