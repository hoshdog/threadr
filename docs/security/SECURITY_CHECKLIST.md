### ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication Tests**
  ```bash
  # Should fail without API key
  curl -X POST https://api.threadr.app/api/generate \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"test"}'
  
  # Should succeed with valid key
  curl -X POST https://api.threadr.app/api/generate \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"test"}'
  ```

- [ ] **Rate Limiting Tests**
  ```bash
  # Should block after limit
  for i in {1..25}; do
    curl -X POST https://api.threadr.app/api/generate \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"text":"test"}'
  done
  ```

- [ ] **SSRF Protection Tests**
  ```bash
  # Should be blocked
  curl -X POST https://api.threadr.app/api/generate \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url":"http://localhost:8080"}'
  
  # Should be blocked
  curl -X POST https://api.threadr.app/api/generate \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url":"http://192.168.1.1"}'
  ```

- [ ] **Security Headers Tests**
  ```bash
  # Check headers
  curl -I https://api.threadr.app/health
  # Verify all security headers present
  ```

- [ ] **Large Payload Tests**
  ```bash
  # Should be rejected
  curl -X POST https://api.threadr.app/api/generate \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"'$(python -c 'print("x"*2000000)')"}'
  ```

### üö® Incident Response Plan

1. **If API Keys Compromised**:
   - [ ] Rotate all API keys immediately
   - [ ] Revoke compromised keys
   - [ ] Audit usage logs
   - [ ] Notify affected users

2. **If Under DDoS Attack**:
   - [ ] Enable Cloudflare "Under Attack" mode
   - [ ] Increase rate limits temporarily
   - [ ] Block attacking regions/IPs
   - [ ] Scale up Railway instances

3. **If Data Breach Suspected**:
   - [ ] Disable affected endpoints
   - [ ] Preserve logs for investigation
   - [ ] Notify security team
   - [ ] Document timeline of events

### üìä Security Metrics to Monitor

- **API Authentication**:
  - Failed authentication attempts/hour
  - Unique API keys used/day
  - Suspicious patterns in key usage

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Rate limit violations/hour
  - Top violating IPs
  - Legitimate users affected

- **Error Rates**:
  - 4xx errors by endpoint
  - 5xx errors indicating attacks
  - Timeout rates

- **Performance Under Load**:
  - Response times during high traffic
  - Memory usage patterns
  - CPU utilization

### üîê Security Contacts
