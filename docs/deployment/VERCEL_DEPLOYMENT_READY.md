## üéØ Deploy to Vercel Now - Two Options

### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended - 5 minutes)

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Import Git Repository**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select your GitHub account
   - Find and import `hoshdog/threadr`

3. **Configure Project**
   - Framework Preset: **Next.js** (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: **threadr-nextjs** (auto-detected from vercel.json)
   - Build Settings: Already configured in vercel.json

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY = [Generate a secure key - see below]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = [Will be shown after deploy, e.g., threadr-xxx.vercel.app]
   ```

5. **Click Deploy** - That's it!

### Option B: CLI Deployment (3 minutes)

```bash
# From project root
npx vercel --prod

# When prompted:
# - Link to existing project? No (create new)
# - What's your project name? threadr-nextjs
# - Which directory? . (current)
# - Override settings? No
```

## üîê Generate API Key for Backend

Add to Railway environment variables:
```python
# Generate secure key
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
# Example: zPX3K2H5J8N9M4Q7R6T8W2Y5A3C6E9F2G5H8K3M6
```

Add the same key to:
- **Railway**: `THREADR_API_KEY=your-key-here`
- **Vercel**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-key-here`

## üîß Common Issues & Fixes

### CORS Errors?
```javascript
// Already configured in backend, but verify:
// Railway should have CORS_ORIGINS including your Vercel URL
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app,https://localhost:3000
```

### API Connection Failed?
1. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel
2. Verify `THREADR_API_KEY` matches in both services
3. Check Railway backend is running

### Build Failed?
- Vercel automatically uses Node 18.x
- All dependencies are in package.json
- Check build logs for specific errors
