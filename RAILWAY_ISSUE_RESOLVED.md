# 🎯 Railway Deployment Issue RESOLVED

## The Real Problem
**Dockerfile was overriding nixpacks.toml!**

Railway's deployment precedence:
1. **Dockerfile** (highest priority) ← You had this!
2. nixpacks.toml ← This was being ignored
3. Automatic detection

Your Dockerfile was hardcoded to use `src.main:app` instead of `src.main_minimal:app`.

## What I Did
1. **Renamed Dockerfile → Dockerfile.disabled**
   - This allows nixpacks.toml to take control
   - Railway will now use the configuration in nixpacks.toml

2. **Created Dockerfile.minimal as backup**
   - Correctly points to main_minimal.py
   - Use only if nixpacks continues to fail

## Deploy NOW (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Commit and Push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - disable Dockerfile to use nixpacks.toml"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor Railway Logs
Look for these SUCCESS indicators:
- ✅ "Using nixpacks" (NOT Docker)
- ✅ "exec uvicorn src.main_minimal:app"
- ✅ NO mention of Dockerfile

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
curl https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "app": "Threadr Minimal",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "deployment": "main_minimal.py"
}
```

## If It Still Fails

### Option A: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Settings → Build & Deploy
2. Look for "Builder" setting
3. Make sure it's set to "Nixpacks" not "Docker"

### Option B: Use Corrected Dockerfile
```bash
git mv Dockerfile.minimal Dockerfile
git commit -m "Use corrected Dockerfile for main_minimal.py"
git push
```

### Option C: Force Nixpacks in Dashboard
1. Railway Dashboard → Settings
2. Add environment variable:
   - `NIXPACKS_BUILD_ENABLED = true`

## Why This Happened
- You had a Dockerfile in the root directory
- Railway always uses Dockerfile if it exists
- The Dockerfile was pointing to the old main.py
- nixpacks.toml was being completely ignored

## Key Learnings
1. **Always check for Dockerfile first** - it overrides everything
2. **Railway precedence matters** - Dockerfile > nixpacks > auto-detect
3. **Simple fix** - just rename/remove the Dockerfile

The deployment should work now! 🚀
