# üöÄ THREADR - IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Situation**: Production app generating ~$250/month, but critical security vulnerability and non-recurring revenue model blocking path to $1K MRR  
**Opportunity**: Fix security + add subscriptions = clear path to $1,349 MRR within 30 days  
**Strategy**: Parallel development - secure Alpine.js while completing Next.js migration  

## üö® PHASE 1: EMERGENCY SECURITY FIX (24 Hours)

### Priority 1: API Key Vulnerability (CRITICAL)
**Risk**: Exposed OpenAI API key could cost $1000s overnight and shut down business  
**Status**: üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  

#### Hour 1-2: Backend Proxy Implementation
```bash
# Create new backend endpoint
cd backend/src/routes
# Create ai_proxy.py (see DOCUMENTATION/security/api-key-emergency-fix.md)
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] New `/ai/generate-thread` endpoint in backend
- [ ] Server-side OpenAI API key handling
- [ ] Test endpoint with Postman/curl

#### Hour 2-3: Frontend Security Update
```bash
# Remove exposed API key
cd frontend/public
# Edit config.js - REMOVE hardcoded API key
# Edit index.html - Update API calls to use backend proxy
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] API key completely removed from frontend
- [ ] All OpenAI calls routed through backend proxy
- [ ] Thread generation still works

#### Hour 3: Deploy & Verify
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "SECURITY: Remove exposed API keys, implement backend proxy"
git push origin main
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] View source of https://threadr-plum.vercel.app - NO API key visible
