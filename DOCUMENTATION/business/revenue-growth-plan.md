# ðŸ’° Threadr Revenue Growth Strategy - $1K MRR Plan

## CURRENT REVENUE ANALYSIS

### What's Working
- âœ… **Live Production App**: Generating actual revenue
- âœ… **Proven Market Demand**: Users willing to pay for thread generation
- âœ… **Payment Infrastructure**: Stripe integration working
- âœ… **Core Value Proposition**: URL â†’ Twitter threads saves time

### Critical Revenue Problems

#### Problem 1: Non-Recurring Revenue Model
**Current**: $4.99 flat fee for 30-day access  
**Issue**: NOT a subscription - users must manually repurchase  
**Impact**: No predictable MRR, requires constant new customer acquisition  

#### Problem 2: Underpriced for Value
**Market Analysis**: Competitors charge $19-99/month for similar tools  
**User Value**: Saves 2-5 hours per week for content creators  
**Current Price**: $4.99 for 30 days = $1.66 per hour of value  

#### Problem 3: No User Retention System
**Current**: No user accounts, no way to track customers  
**Issue**: 80%+ churn rate, no customer lifetime value tracking  
**Impact**: Cannot optimize funnel or increase retention
