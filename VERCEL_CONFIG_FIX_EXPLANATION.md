# üö® VERCEL CONFIGURATION FIX

## The Problem
You got the error: "Environment Variable 'THREADR_API_KEY' references Secret 'threadr_api_key', which does not exist."

This happened because:
1. The old `vercel.json` was trying to reference a Vercel "secret" with `@threadr_api_key`
2. You correctly added an environment variable, but not a secret
3. Vercel secrets and environment variables are different things

## The Solution ‚úÖ

I've fixed this by:

1. **Created root-level vercel.json** - Vercel looks for config at project root
2. **Removed secret references** - Now uses direct environment variables
3. **Updated build configuration** - Properly passes `THREADR_API_KEY` to build process

## New Vercel Configuration

The new `vercel.json` uses this format:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "THREADR_API_KEY": "$THREADR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Instead of the problematic:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "THREADR_API_KEY": "@threadr_api_key"
    }
  }
}
```

## What This Means

- ‚úÖ **Your environment variable setup is correct** - Keep `THREADR_API_KEY` as you configured it
- ‚úÖ **No secrets needed** - Direct environment variable usage
- ‚úÖ **Deployment will now work** - No more "secret does not exist" error

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push the changes** (I'll do this)
2. **Deploy in Vercel** - Should work without the error now
3. **Verify deployment** - Check that your API key is secure

## Understanding Vercel Secrets vs Environment Variables

### Environment Variables (What you used ‚úÖ)
- Added in project settings
- Visible in project dashboard
- Used directly in build process
- Perfect for your use case

### Secrets (What the old config tried to use ‚ùå)
- Created separately via CLI or API
- Referenced with `@secret_name`
- More complex setup
- Unnecessary for your needs

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ Created: `/vercel.json` (root level with correct config)
- ‚úÖ Removed: `/frontend/vercel.json` (to avoid conflicts)
- ‚úÖ Updated: Build process to use environment variables directly

Your deployment should now work perfectly with the environment variable you already configured!
