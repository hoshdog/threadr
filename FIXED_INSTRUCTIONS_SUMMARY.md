# ✅ FIXED: Vercel Environment Variable Instructions

## The Issue Has Been Resolved!

You discovered that Vercel doesn't allow hyphens in environment variable names. I've fixed all documentation and pushed the updates.

## 🎯 Corrected Instructions

### In Vercel Dashboard:

1. **Variable Name**: `THREADR_API_KEY` *(use underscores, not hyphens!)*
2. **Variable Value**: `zfQBge1AsBBLF8nMNxiHdyFn-_fS7vsTtcTrveXnyD8`
3. **Environments**: ✅ All (Production, Preview, Development)
4. **Sensitive**: ✅ Yes

## 📁 Updated Files

All documentation has been corrected and pushed to GitHub:
- ✅ Fixed naming in all setup guides
- ✅ Added warnings about the underscore requirement
- ✅ Created visual guide: `VERCEL_VARIABLE_NAME_FIX.md`
- ✅ Updated scripts with correct variable name

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add the environment variable** in Vercel with the correct name
2. **Redeploy** your application
3. **Continue with Redis setup** (Railway or Upstash)
4. **Run verification**: `run_verification_suite.bat`

## 📋 Quick Copy-Paste

**Name**: 
```
THREADR_API_KEY
```

**Value**:
```
zfQBge1AsBBLF8nMNxiHdyFn-_fS7vsTtcTrveXnyD8
```

## ✨ What's Been Fixed

- All references to `threadr-api-key` → `THREADR_API_KEY`
- Clear warnings added about Vercel's naming rules
- Visual guides showing exactly what to type
- Scripts updated with the correct variable name

## 🎉 You're Back on Track!

The naming issue was the only blocker. Once you add the variable with the correct name (`THREADR_API_KEY`), everything will work as designed:
- API key will be secure
- UX improvements will be live
- Redis can be configured next
- Premium transformation continues!

**Remember**: Always use underscores (_) not hyphens (-) for environment variable names in Vercel!
