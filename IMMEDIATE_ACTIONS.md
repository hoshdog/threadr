# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS - Threadr Production Launch

## Your Backend is LIVE! Here's what to do next:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix OpenAI (5 minutes) - CRITICAL
**The Issue**: OpenAI API quota exceeded - AI thread generation not working

### Action Steps:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Click "Add payment method" or "Upgrade plan"
3. Add $10-20 credits (enough for ~1000 thread generations)
4. Verify your API key is active
5. Test immediately:
```bash
curl -X POST https://threadr-pw0s.onrender.com/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Test AI generation"}'
```

**Expected Result**: Threads generated with GPT-3.5-turbo

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Redis (10 minutes) - IMPORTANT
**The Issue**: Redis not connected - rate limiting resets on deployment

### Option A: Use Render Redis (Recommended)
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. New+ ‚Üí Redis
3. Name: `threadr-redis`
4. Plan: Free (or Starter for persistence)
5. Create Redis
6. Copy Internal Redis URL
7. Add to threadr-backend environment:
   - Key: `REDIS_URL`
   - Value: `redis://red-xxxxx:6379` (your URL)
8. Redeploy

### Option B: Use External Redis (Upstash/RedisLabs)
1. Create free Redis at https://upstash.com
2. Copy Redis URL with password
3. Add to Render environment variables
4. Redeploy

**Test Redis Connection**:
```bash
curl https://threadr-pw0s.onrender.com/health
# Should show: "redis": true
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Everything (5 minutes)
Once OpenAI and Redis are connected:

### Run Full Test Suite:
```bash
python scripts/health-checks/test_full_backend.py
```

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Health: All services green
- ‚úÖ Generate: Uses OpenAI (not fallback)
- ‚úÖ Redis: Connected and caching
- ‚úÖ Rate Limiting: Persistent across restarts

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test Frontend Integration (5 minutes)

### Visit Your Live App:
1. Go to: https://threadr-plum.vercel.app
2. Try generating a thread
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test premium upgrade flow

### If CORS errors appear:
1. Go to Render environment variables
2. Add: `CORS_ORIGINS=https://threadr-plum.vercel.app`
3. Redeploy

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Activate Payments (15 minutes) - OPTIONAL

### Stripe Setup:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard
2. Get your Secret Key (starts with `sk_`)
3. Add to Render: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...`
4. Set up webhook:
   - Endpoint URL: `https://threadr-pw0s.onrender.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Add webhook secret: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
6. Test with Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
