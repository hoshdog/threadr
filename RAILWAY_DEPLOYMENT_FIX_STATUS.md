# üîß RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX - STATUS UPDATE

## **GOOD NEWS: The Import Error Has Been Fixed!** ‚úÖ

The subscription.py import error was fixed in commit `53c2270` and has been pushed to GitHub. Railway should automatically redeploy with this fix.

## üö® **Additional Issue Found: JWT_SECRET_KEY Warning**

Your logs show this warning repeating:
```
Using auto-generated JWT_SECRET_KEY. This should be set in production!
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- JWT tokens are used for user authentication
- Without a fixed secret key, tokens become invalid on each restart
- This could log users out unexpectedly

### **Quick Fix:**
Add this to your Railway environment variables:
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-very-long-random-secret-key-here-at-least-32-chars
```

You can generate one using:
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```
