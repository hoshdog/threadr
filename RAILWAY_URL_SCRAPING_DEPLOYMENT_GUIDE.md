# Railway URL Scraping Fix - Deployment Guide

## Overview
The URL scraping issue has been fixed with comprehensive enhancements to handle Railway's container environment. The fix includes:

1. **SSL/TLS Flexibility**: Automatic fallback when SSL verification fails
2. **Retry Mechanism**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
3. **Proxy Support**: Automatic detection of HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Clear error messages with actionable solutions
5. **Multiple CA Bundle Locations**: Checks various standard locations for certificates

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push the Updated Code

```bash
git add backend/main.py
git commit -m "Fix Railway URL scraping with enhanced SSL handling and retries"
git push
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Optional)

If you continue to experience SSL issues, add this to Railway:

```bash
HTTPX_VERIFY_SSL=false
```

**Note**: Only use this as a last resort. The code now automatically retries without SSL verification if the first attempt fails.

### 3. Monitor Deployment

Watch the Railway deployment logs for:
- Successful uvicorn startup
- No import errors
- Health check passing

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Basic Health

```bash
curl https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

### 2. Test Network Diagnostics

```bash
curl https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/api/test/railway-network
```

This will show:
- DNS resolution status
- CA bundle availability
- HTTP connectivity tests
- Railway environment variables

### 3. Test URL Scraping

Using the frontend:
1. Go to https://threadr-plum.vercel.app
2. Paste a URL like: https://medium.com/@username/article-title
3. Click "Generate Thread"
4. Should see successful thread generation

Using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: zfQBge1AsBBLF8nMNxiHdyFn-_fS7vsTtcTrveXnyD8" \
  -d '{"url": "https://medium.com/@elonmusk/the-secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me-efc52dd9c7f1"}'
```

### 4. Test Different URLs

Try these test URLs to verify compatibility:
- Medium: `https://medium.com/p/sample-article`
- Dev.to: `https://dev.to/ben/sample-article`
- Personal blogs: `https://seasonsincolour.com`

## What's Fixed

### Previous Issues:
- ❌ SSL certificate verification failures
- ❌ Connection timeouts in Railway's network
- ❌ No retry mechanism
- ❌ Poor error messages

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Automatic SSL fallback (tries with and without verification)
- ✅ 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- ✅ Checks multiple CA bundle locations
- ✅ Proxy support for restricted networks
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Clear error messages with solutions

## Monitoring Success

Look for these log entries in Railway:

```
Starting URL scrape for: https://medium.com/...
DNS resolution for medium.com: ['162.159.153.4', '162.159.152.4']
Using CA bundle from: /app/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem
Attempt 1/3: Creating httpx client (verify_ssl=True)
Fetching URL: https://medium.com/...
Response received - Status: 200, Content-Length: 123456
```

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Run Network Diagnostics**:
   ```bash
   curl https://threadr-production.up.railway.app/api/test/railway-network | jq
   ```

3. **Try with SSL Disabled** (temporary):
   Add to Railway environment variables:
   ```
   HTTPX_VERIFY_SSL=false
   ```

4. **Check for Proxy Requirements**:
   Some Railway deployments may require proxy configuration:
   ```
   HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.railway.internal:3128
   HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.railway.internal:3128
   ```

## Success Indicators

- ✅ URL scraping returns 200 status
- ✅ Thread generation completes successfully
- ✅ No SSL/TLS errors in logs
- ✅ Response times under 10 seconds

## Next Steps

Once confirmed working:
1. Remove any temporary `HTTPX_VERIFY_SSL=false` setting
2. Monitor for consistent performance
3. Consider adding caching for frequently accessed URLs

The implementation now handles the most common Railway deployment issues automatically. The retry mechanism and SSL fallback should resolve most connectivity problems without manual intervention.
