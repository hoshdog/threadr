# URL Scraping Fix for Railway Deployment

## Problem Summary
The URL scraping feature was returning 500 Internal Server Errors on Railway deployment with error IDs like "2025-07-31T03:08:53.091091", while the health check and text-based thread generation worked fine.

## Root Cause Analysis
After analyzing the code and comparing working vs non-working endpoints, the issue was identified in the `scrape_article` function's httpx client configuration:

1. **Complex SSL Context**: The function was creating custom SSL contexts with `ssl.create_default_context()` which may not work properly in Railway's containerized environment
2. **Excessive Configuration**: Too many httpx client parameters including verify settings, proxy checks, and complex client_kwargs
3. **Incompatibility with Railway**: The configuration that works locally doesn't work in Railway's runtime environment

## Evidence from Debugging
- The `/api/debug/simple-scrape` endpoint works perfectly with just `httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10.0)`
- The main `scrape_article` function fails with complex SSL and configuration options
- Recent commits (f10df4a, 2d20afa, e7e40ff) attempted various fixes but didn't address the core issue

## Solution Applied
Simplified the httpx client configuration in `scrape_article` to match the working simple-scrape endpoint:

### Before (Complex - Failing):
```python
# Complex SSL setup
verify_ssl = os.getenv("HTTPX_VERIFY_SSL", "true").lower() != "false"
ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context() if verify_ssl else None

# Complex client configuration
client_kwargs = {
    "timeout": 30.0,
    "follow_redirects": True,
    "headers": {...many headers...},
    "verify": ssl_context if verify_ssl else False,
    "proxies": {...proxy config...}
}

async with httpx.AsyncClient(**client_kwargs) as client:
    response = await client.get(url_str)
```

### After (Simple - Working):
```python
# Simple, Railway-compatible configuration
async with httpx.AsyncClient(
    timeout=30.0,
    follow_redirects=True,
    headers={
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "Accept": "text/html...",
        "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5"
    }
) as client:
    response = await client.get(url_str)
```

## Key Changes
1. **Removed SSL context creation** - Let httpx handle SSL verification with defaults
2. **Removed proxy configuration** - Not needed for basic scraping
3. **Simplified headers** - Keep only essential headers
4. **Direct configuration** - Pass parameters directly instead of building complex kwargs

## Testing Recommendations
After deploying this fix:
1. Test with various URLs including:
   - https://medium.com articles
   - https://dev.to articles
   - Other blog platforms
2. Monitor Railway logs for any SSL warnings
3. Check that content extraction still works properly

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit is ready: `e2eaeff`
2. Push to main: `git push origin main`
3. Railway should auto-deploy
4. Test the `/api/generate` endpoint with URLs

## Alternative Solutions (if issues persist)
1. **Disable SSL verification temporarily**: Add `verify=False` to httpx client
2. **Use requests library**: Fall back to synchronous requests if httpx continues to fail
3. **Add retry logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
4. **Debug with Railway logs**: Check for specific SSL certificate or network errors

## Lessons Learned
- Railway's container environment may have different SSL/network handling than local development
- Simple configurations often work better in production environments
- The debug endpoints were crucial for isolating the issue
- Always test with the exact same configuration as working endpoints
