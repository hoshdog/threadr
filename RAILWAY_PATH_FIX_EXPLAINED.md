# 🔧 Railway Path Fix - Understanding the Issue

## The Problem
Railway build failed with: `ls: cannot access 'src/': No such file or directory`

## Root Cause
We were mixing working directory contexts:
- `workDir = "backend"` changes the working directory
- But during setup phase, source files might not be available yet
- Commands were trying to verify files that weren't copied yet

## The Fix Applied
Removed `workDir` and use explicit paths instead:
```toml
# BEFORE (failed):
workDir = "backend"
cmds = ["ls -la src/"]  # Error: src/ not found

# AFTER (fixed):
# No workDir - start from repo root
cmds = ["pip install -r backend/requirements.txt"]  # Explicit path
cmd = "cd backend && uvicorn src.main_minimal:app"  # Navigate then run
```

## Directory Structure Confirmed
```
/ (repo root)
├── nixpacks.toml
├── railway.json
└── backend/
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── src/
        └── main_minimal.py  ← Our target file
```

## Key Changes
1. **Removed workDir** - Start from repo root for clarity
2. **Explicit paths** - Use `backend/requirements.txt`
3. **Simple setup** - Only install dependencies, don't verify files
4. **Clear start command** - `cd backend && uvicorn...`

## Why This Works
- No assumptions about when files are available
- Clear, explicit paths from root
- Railway can follow the path navigation
- Simpler is more reliable

## Next Deployment Should:
1. Successfully install dependencies
2. Navigate to backend directory
3. Start uvicorn with main_minimal.py
4. No more "directory not found" errors
