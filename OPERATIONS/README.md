## Deployment Operations

### Automated Deployment
The deployment system handles both frontend (Vercel) and backend (Railway) deployments with proper coordination and rollback capabilities.

#### Current Deployment Flow
```
Code Commit â†’ GitHub â†’ Webhook â†’ Auto Deploy â†’ Health Check â†’ Success/Rollback
     â†“            â†“        â†“          â†“           â†“              â†“
   Git Push   â†’ Trigger â†’ Vercel â†’ Railway â†’ Monitoring â†’ Notification
```

#### Deployment Scripts
```bash
# Main deployment script
python OPERATIONS/deployment/auto-deploy.py

# Emergency rollback
python OPERATIONS/deployment/rollback.py --environment production

# Health verification
python OPERATIONS/deployment/health-check.py --full-suite
```

### Deployment Automation Features

- **Environment Management**: Support for staging and production

### Manual Deployment Procedures

#### Emergency Deployment (Critical Fixes)
```bash
# 1. Hotfix preparation
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# 2. Apply fix and test
# Make necessary changes
pytest backend/tests/
npm test  # (for Next.js when ready)

# 3. Deploy immediately
git add .
git commit -m "HOTFIX: Critical security vulnerability"
git push origin hotfix/critical-security-fix

# 4. Merge and deploy
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-security-fix
git push origin main
# Auto-deployment triggers

# 5. Verify deployment
python OPERATIONS/deployment/health-check.py --critical
```

#### Scheduled Deployment (Regular Updates)
```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment checks
python OPERATIONS/testing/production-test.py
python OPERATIONS/monitoring/health-monitor.py --baseline

# 2. Deploy with verification
python OPERATIONS/deployment/auto-deploy.py --environment production --verify

# 3. Post-deployment monitoring
python OPERATIONS/monitoring/performance.py --watch 300  # 5 minutes
```

## Monitoring Operations

### Health Monitoring System
Continuous monitoring of all system components with automatic alerting and recovery procedures.

#### Monitoring Components
- **Application Health**: API endpoints, response times, error rates
- **Infrastructure Health**: Server resources, database connections
- **Business Metrics**: User activity, revenue metrics, conversion rates
- **Security Monitoring**: Failed auth attempts, suspicious activity
- **Cost Monitoring**: API usage costs, infrastructure spending

#### Monitoring Scripts
```bash
# Continuous health monitoring
python OPERATIONS/monitoring/health-monitor.py --daemon

# Cost tracking and alerts
python OPERATIONS/monitoring/cost-tracker.py --alert-threshold 100

# Performance metrics collection
python OPERATIONS/monitoring/performance.py --collect-metrics
```

### Alert Management
```python
# Alert configuration example
ALERT_RULES = {
    'api_response_time': {
        'threshold': 2000,  # 2 seconds
        'severity': 'warning',
        'action': 'scale_backend'
    },
    'error_rate': {
        'threshold': 0.05,  # 5%
        'severity': 'critical',
        'action': 'rollback_deploy'
    },
    'cost_spike': {
        'threshold': 200,  # $200/day
        'severity': 'critical',
        'action': 'rate_limit_tightening'
    }
}
```

### Monitoring Dashboards
- **Business Dashboard**: Revenue, users, conversion rates
- **Technical Dashboard**: Performance, errors, uptime
- **Security Dashboard**: Authentication, rate limiting, threats
- **Cost Dashboard**: API costs, infrastructure spending

## Testing Operations

#### Test Categories
1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user workflows
3. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
4. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning
5. **Business Logic Tests**: Revenue and user management

#### Testing Scripts
```bash
# Full production test suite
python OPERATIONS/testing/production-test.py --full

# Load testing
python OPERATIONS/testing/load-test.py --users 100 --duration 300

# Security scanning
python OPERATIONS/testing/security-scan.py --comprehensive
```

## Backup and Recovery Operations

### Backup Strategy
```
Data Type          Frequency    Retention    Method
-------------------------------------------------
Code Repository    Real-time    Indefinite   Git (GitHub)
Database (Redis)   Daily        30 days      Upstash Auto
Environment Config Weekly       90 days      Encrypted Store
User Data          Daily        1 year       PostgreSQL Backup
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Data Recovery
```bash
# Restore from Redis backup
python OPERATIONS/recovery/restore-redis.py --date 2025-08-01

# Restore user data (when PostgreSQL implemented)
python OPERATIONS/recovery/restore-database.py --backup-id latest

# Restore application configuration
python OPERATIONS/recovery/restore-config.py --environment production
```

#### Disaster Recovery Plan
1. **Assessment**: Determine scope of failure
2. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders and users
3. **Recovery**: Execute appropriate recovery procedures
4. **Verification**: Confirm systems are restored
5. **Post-mortem**: Document incident and improvements

## Security Operations

### Security Monitoring
- **Authentication Failures**: Track failed login attempts
- **API Abuse**: Monitor for unusual usage patterns
- **Security Headers**: Verify security headers are present
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments

### Security Incident Response

#### Incident Classification
- **P0 (Critical)**: Active security breach, data exposure
- **P1 (High)**: Potential vulnerability with high impact
- **P2 (Medium)**: Security weakness requiring attention
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor security improvement needed

#### Response Procedures
```bash
# Security incident response
python OPERATIONS/security/incident-response.py --severity P0

# Emergency security lockdown
python OPERATIONS/security/lockdown.py --mode emergency

# Security audit
python OPERATIONS/security/audit.py --comprehensive
```

## Cost Management Operations

### Cost Monitoring
Track and optimize costs across all services to maintain profitability.

#### Cost Components
- **OpenAI API**: Thread generation costs
- **Railway**: Backend hosting and scaling
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting (currently free)
- **Upstash**: Redis database costs
- **Stripe**: Payment processing fees

#### Cost Optimization Scripts
```bash
# Daily cost analysis
python OPERATIONS/cost/analyze-costs.py --date today

# Cost projection
python OPERATIONS/cost/project-costs.py --period monthly

# Cost optimization recommendations
python OPERATIONS/cost/optimize.py --suggestions
```

### Cost Alerts and Controls
```python
# Cost control configuration
COST_CONTROLS = {
    'openai': {
        'daily_limit': 50,     # $50/day
        'monthly_limit': 1000, # $1000/month
        'action': 'rate_limit'
    },
    'railway': {
        'daily_limit': 10,     # $10/day
        'monthly_limit': 200,  # $200/month
        'action': 'scale_down'
    }
}
```

## Performance Operations
