# ✅ Railway Deployment Fixed - TOML Syntax Error Resolved

## The Real Issue (Found!)
Railway build was failing with:
```
Error: Failed to parse Nixpacks config file `nixpacks.toml`
Caused by: invalid type: map, expected a sequence for key `providers` at line 38 column 1
```

## What Was Wrong
```toml
# INCORRECT - This caused the error
[providers]
python = "3.11"
```

## What We Fixed
```toml
# CORRECT - providers must be an array
providers = ["python"]

# Python version specified in setup phase
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python311", "gcc"]

# And in environment variables
[variables]
PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"
```

## Changes Applied
1. ✅ Changed `[providers]` section to `providers = ["python"]` array
2. ✅ Added `nixPkgs = ["python311", "gcc"]` to setup phase
3. ✅ Added `PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"` to variables
4. ✅ Validated TOML syntax - no errors

## Deployment Should Now:
1. Parse nixpacks.toml successfully
2. Use Python 3.11
3. Deploy main_minimal.py as configured
4. Show build logs with our debug messages

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the fix
2. Monitor Railway build logs
3. Look for "BUILD PHASE" and "SETUP PHASE" messages
4. Verify deployment uses main_minimal.py

## Success Indicators
- ✅ Build starts without TOML parse error
- ✅ Logs show "Using main_minimal.py for deployment"
- ✅ Health endpoint returns `{"app": "minimal"}`
- ✅ No more 503 errors

The TOML syntax error was preventing Railway from even reading our configuration. Now it should work!
